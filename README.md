The project activity titled, SBPIL Waste Heat to Power Project, Borjhara, India is located in
Urla Industrial Area, Village: Borjhara, District: Raipur, State: Chhattisgarh, Country: India.

Purpose of the project activity:
GOEL GROUP of Industries is one of the leading business houses in the State of Chhattisgarh,
India. The group has entered into the business of Iron & Steel with a Re-Rolling Mill in the name
of M/s Shri Bajrang Alliance Ltd. (formerly known as M/s Shri Bajrang Alloys Ltd). M/s Shri
Bajrang Power & Ispat Ltd belongs to this group has also entered in the business of TMT Bars,
which is selling the product under the brand name Goel TMT.

The group has been further strengthened by establishing Shri Bajrang Power and Ispat Limited
(“SBPIL”) which has emerged as one of the leading integrated steel companies based out of central
India and is one of the top 10 players in India in terms of capacity for iron ore pellets, iron ore
beneficiation and sponge iron. The plant was commissioned in 2005 (also called Unit I)
manufactures TMT Bars, Ferro alloys, steel billets, sponge iron and fly ash bricks. 

The project activity takes place at a sponge iron plant (Unit I) and involves the generation of electrical power
through the installation of waste heat recovery boilers and steam turbine generators (STGs). The
waste heat produced during the manufacture of sponge iron is passed through boilers and the
resultant steam is utilised to generate electrical power. The power generated from two condensing
turbines (8 MW and 10 MW) is consumed in captive requirements and surplus is exported to the
grid via Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB). 

The energy generated in the project is
measured by meters installed at both STGs in the power plant. The project activity was
commissioned in phase wise wherein the 8 MW STG started operating on 12/07/2005 and 10 MW
STG started operating on 31/08/2005 and has been operating till date on regular basis.
The electricity is generated at 11 kV which is then stepped up to 132 kV in the plant before being
fed through a 132 kV sub-station (Urla substation). Apart from the waste heat recovery boilers,
steam from an AFBC boiler is also added to the common steam header (from September 2008
onwards), however carbon credits or CoUs are not being claimed for the increased generation due to
the additional steam source (this additional steam source has been added as the turbines cannot run
at their rated capacity with the steam from the waste heat recovery boilers only). 

This apportioning
of generation based on steam supply is in line with the tool in the methodology. The project activity
thus entails utilisation of waste heat of flue gases generated in Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) kilns of
sponge iron plants of SBPIL (Project Proponent or PP hereafter) in power generation. DRI, is a
type of kiln used in the production of sponge iron, where iron ore is reduced to sponge iron using
coal & Iron ore through a rotary Kiln at high temperature (1000 0C). 

The reduction process yields
carbon di-oxide and carbon monoxide. This waste heat of flue gases is utilised in the generation of
steam in (WHRB), which is further expanded in two turbines with total installed capacity 18MW
(08 MW+ 10 MW) to generate power. The 8MW turbine generator was synchronised with the grid
on 12/07/2005, while the 10MW turbine generator was synchronised with the grid on 31/08/2005.
After these synchronisations, the turbines were tested and trials were undertaken on 01/09/2005 and
this would be the earliest commissioning date that the project activity could evacuate electricity to
the grid
